# ZK-Based Authentication System using zkAuth Kit

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK Proof)** based authentication system using the **zkAuth Kit**. The project simulates a registration and login flow with ZK proof verification by integrating **WebAssembly (WASM)** compiled JavaScript files within a front-end application. This approach aims to enhance security by enabling user authentication without exposing sensitive information like passwords.

## Objective

- Develop a front-end authentication system that supports registration and login using **zero-knowledge proofs**.
- Implement registration by hashing the password and saving it in a simulated backend.
- Implement login by generating a ZK proof of credentials and verifying it against the stored hash.

## Features

- **Registration Flow**: Users can register with a username and password, which are securely hashed and stored.
- **Login Flow**: Users log in with their credentials, generating a ZK proof that is verified on the backend.
- **Error Handling**: Validation for failed proofs and invalid inputs ensures a smooth user experience.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: UI components for registration and login flows.
- **WASM Integration**: Compiled WebAssembly JavaScript functions (`get_pass_hash`, `generate_proof`, and `verify_proof`) for ZK proof-based authentication.
- **Simulated Backend**: Basic storage for password hashes and proof verification.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (for frontend setup)
- **zkAuth Kit**: Clone the `pkg` folder into the `src` directory for WASM integration.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zk-authentication.git
   cd zk-authentication
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Place the **zkAuth Kit** `pkg` folder into the `src` directory as instructed.

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Registration Flow

1. **Registration Page**: Allows users to input a username and password.
2. **Hash Generation**: Uses the `get_pass_hash` function from the WASM file to create a password hash.
3. **Storage**: Saves the hashed password in a simulated backend (can be any local database or storage method).

### Login Flow

1. **Login Page**: Users enter their username and password.
2. **Proof Generation**: Calls `generate_proof` from the WASM file to create a ZK proof of the provided credentials.
3. **Backend Verification**: Verifies the proof against the stored password hash using the `verify_proof` function, displaying success or failure messages based on the outcome.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: Ensure the seamless operation of registration and login processes, including hash storage and ZK proof verification.
- **Code Structure**: Maintain modularity and organization with a clear separation between front-end components and WASM calls.
- **Error Handling**: Validate user inputs and handle errors (e.g., failed proof verification, invalid inputs).

## Example Usage

1. Register with a username and password on the registration page.
2. Log in using the same credentials.
3. Observe proof-based verification results as a success or failure message.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Primary language for frontend.
- **WebAssembly (WASM)**: For ZK proof functions (password hashing, proof generation, verification).
- **Local Storage**: Simulated backend for storing hashed passwords.
